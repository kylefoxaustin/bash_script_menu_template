# Provides a basic template for a menu script
This menu is 'weighted' towards command line operation instead of interactive menu.
Why?  to get the interactive menu you have to type in "menu.sh -m".  Just typing
in "menu.s" in the command line gives you usage information
I will build a new branch which starts off in interactive mode by default
